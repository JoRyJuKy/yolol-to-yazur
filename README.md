# yolol-to-yazur README

you can only have 1 folder opened in vscode at once  
within the main folder you can have as many folders as you like, each will be a separate YOLOL network
each .yolol file will be treated as an individual chip, and each .yololmem file will be treated as a individual memory chip

report any bugs to jory#7000 or submit an issue on github at: https://github.com/JoRyJuKy/yolol-to-yazur  

huge thanks to Azurethi#0789 for making Yazur (https://github.com/Azurethi/Yazur) and allowing me to release this plugin
